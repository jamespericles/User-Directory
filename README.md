### <a name="Description"></a>Description
User-Directory is a proof of concept for a workplace directory. Taking advantage of the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/), the app generates 150 fake users and then appends their data to the appropriate location on the page. This would be handy for a pseudo company-wide social networking application that would help larger companies and their employees have an easy way to find other employees.
